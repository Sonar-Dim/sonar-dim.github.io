        <h1>Really Honest Book Reviews</h1>
        <p>I read a lot of books about many diffrent subjects. Though I'm not a book critic, and I don't do this for a living, I enjoy a really a good read every now and then. Here's a list of books that I've read recently:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="rainbow.html"><em>The Rainbow Returns</em> by E. Smith</a>. A fantasy story set in biblical times. Slow at times but interesting.</li>
            <li><a href="wealth.html"><em>Seven Steps to Immeasurable Wealth</em> by R.U. Needy</a>. I'm still poor but I'm happy! And that's the whole point.</li>
            <li><a href="food.html"><em>The Food-Lovers Guide to Weight Loss</em> by L. Goode</a>. At last a diet book with recipe that taste good!</li>
            <li><a href="silly.html"><em>The Silly Person's Guide to Seriousness</em> by M. Nott</a>. Come on...who wants to be setious?</li>
        </ul>
